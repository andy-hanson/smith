	‣ + a:ℝ
		doc
			Combination of two counts, one done after the other.
			The method is addition and the result is the sum.

				1.+ -2

		`this + a`

	‣ - a:ℝ
		doc
			Number of steps up from `a` to this.
			For number of steps irrespective of direction, use `distance`.
			The method is subtraction and the result is the difference.
		eg
			✔= 1
				3.- 2
			✔= -1
				2.- 3

		`this - a`

	‣ × a:ℝ
		doc
			Sum of this many copies of a.
			The method is multiplication and the result is the product.

				-2.× 3
			✔= 6
				-2.× -3

		`this * a`

	‣ ÷ divisor:ℝ
		doc
			How many copies of divisor are needed to make me.
			The method is division and the result is the ratio (or quotient).

				-6.÷ 3
			✔= 2
				-6.÷ -3

		`this / divisor`

		1.÷ me

	‣ half
		doc
			Half of me.
		eg
			✔= 2
				4.half

		÷ 2

	‣ twice
		doc
			Me + me.
		eg

				2.twice

		× 2

	‣ square
		doc
			Me × me.
		eg
			✔= 4
				2.square

		× me

	‣ cube
		doc
			Me × me × me.
		eg
			✔= 8
				2.cube

		× square

	‣ square-root
		doc
			Number whose square is me.
		eg
			✔= 2
				4.square-root
			✔.fails
				-1.square-root

		(Math.sqrt me).forbid-NaN

	‣ cube-root
		doc
			Number whose cube is me.
		eg
			✔= 2
				8.cube-root
			✔.fails
				-1.cube-root
		how

		me.^ 3.inverse

	‣ nth-root n:ℝ
		eg
			✔= 2
				8.nth-root 3
		^ n.inverse


	‣ square-hypoteneuse a:ℝ
		doc
			Square of the hypoteneuse.
			Easier to compute than it.
		eg
			✔= 25
				3.square-hypoteneuse 4

		square.+ a.square

	‣ hypoteneuse a:ℝ
		doc
			After moving me far right and `a` far up, the displacement.
		eg
			✔= 5
				3.hypoteneuse 4
		how
			TODO: Math.hypot

		(square-hypoteneuse a).square-root


	‣ average a:ℝ
		doc
			Number in between this and a.
		eg
			✔= 2
				1.average 3

		(+ a).half

	‣ negate
		doc
