How do we get Syntax-Test.smith to look cool?

Sublime Text

`cake install-sublime-files` will put the files you need in ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User/ .
The settings I use are in Smith.sublime-settings.
"color_scheme" is the only necessary setting.

You're out of luck for now. Maybe some day it will work.
